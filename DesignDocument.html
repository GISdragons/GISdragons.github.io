	<div class="new_h2">How was the software built?</div>
	<div class="p1">
		This website was built using godaddy.com to find a domain name
		and Github pages to host this website.
	</div>

	<div class="new_h3">Domain Name</div>
	<div class="p1">
		Our domain name of "mormonhistorygis.com" was purchased from 
		<a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank"
		style="color:white">godaddy.com</a> for 1 dollar a month for 12
		months. With this deal we also received access to their website
		builder. Their website builder, however, it did not provided
		access to the basic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS control that we
		wanted to have.
	</div>

	<div class="new_h3">Hosting</div>
	<div class="p1">
		We decided to use <a href="https://pages.github.com/" 
		target="_blank" style="color:white" >Github Pages</a> to host our
		HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other files so that we could have full
		control over the content and display of our website. This hosting
		is provided for free as long as the code is open source. Our
		repository setup on Github is named <a href="https://github.com/GISdragons/GISdragons.github.io"
		target="_blank" style="color:white" >GISdragons.githb.io</a>.
		Our set-up for the website was done in the following way:
	</div>

	<div class="new_h3">Set-up</div>
	<img src="DNS_Zone_File.jpg">
	<br>
	<div class="p1">
		Using the site manager provided by godaddy.com, we went to the
		"DNS Zone File" to change some settings to point to the Github
		Pages server and our Github Repository. Here on this website we
		had to change two sections. First, the "A (Host)" section needed
		to point to the Github Pages IP address. This was done by deleting
		the default address and adding the "@" name to "192.30.252.153".
		Also, The "CName (Alias)" section was also changed. The default "www"
		pointer was changed to point to our repository named
		"GISdragons.github.io". (NOTE: Github recommends that you do NOT
		change both if you want to keep the emailing system for your
		website. Refer to their help pages on A and CName files to find
		out specifically what you need to do for your situation. For our
		website, it was necessary to change both to get the hosting to
		work)
	</div>

	<div class="p1">
		For the Github pages, since there are two main creators of the
		website, we made a Github Organization so that both could edit and
		manage the website files. We chose the name "GISdragons". Next,
		we needed to create a repository. Following the Github pages
		recommendation, we created the repository name
		"GISdragons.github.io". This repository name was used because it
		was our group name, followed by the ".github.io" to help show that
		it was a Github Pages hosting repository. Inside this repository,
		it was required for us to set-up a "A" and "CNAME" files that only
		contained our website domain "mormonhistorygis.com". Also inside
		our repository, we needed to have an "index.html" file that is the
		main page for website.
	</div>

	<div class="p1">
		By using the following method, we were able to host our website at
		a different location than where we purchased the domain name,
		without the domain name changing to the location of our hosting.
		Also, it the hosting was free, which in the long run could lower
		future cost as it does cost more to keep the domain name and hosting
		for the website.
	</div>

	<div class="new_h2">Who built it?</div>
	<div class="p1">
		This website was created by Stephen Duncan and Preston Merrell.
	</div>

	<div class="new_h2">What is it's license?</div>
	<div class="p1">

	</div>

	<div class="new_h2">What are the hardware and software limitations/requirements?</div>
	<div class="p1">
		The limitations of our website and software are that they are based
		on our limited knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and KML as well
		as our limited knowledge of the life of Joseph Smith. We have based
		our website on just a few significant places from the life of the
		prophet Joseph Smith Jr. If you would like a more significant view
		on his life, you can visit <a href="https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng"
		target="_blank" style="color:white" >LDS.org</a> or any other
		website sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
		Saints.

	<div class="new_h1">Software Design</div>
	<br>

	<div class="new_h2">What is the purpose of the software?</div>
	<div class="p1">
		The purpose of this website is to share some of the significant places and events in the life
		of the prophet Joseph Smith Jr. He was the first prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
		Saints. We wanted to share some of those sites and places that are historically significant to his
		family or the church in general. This is our simple way of sharing that information.
	</div>
	
	<!-- note: the #tooplate and #gallery in the CSS might affect the <ul> and <li> stuff
	we shall find out soon enough :) -->
	<div class="new_h2">What is the software structure?</div>
	<div class="p1">
		Our software uses four different types of codes. They are:
		<ul>
			<li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</li>
			<li>JavaScript</li>
			<li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)</li>
			<li>KML (Keyhole Markup Language)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<img src="Software_Structure.jpg" style="width: 80%">
	<div class="p1">
		The HTML and CSS are the base to this project, making up most of the code and formatting behind the website.
		Most of this code is being held inside our index.html and style.css sheets at our Github pages repository.
		Also included in our files are the Open Layers 3 CSS and JavaScript libraries so that we could display our
		KML and image files for the user. We also created our own map.js JavaScript file to create the personal map
		and allow for some interaction with the user. The other files, like images, are also stored on the Github
		repository for the HTML and KML to have direct links to them. Finally, the A and CNAME files are also stored
		on the repository to help direct the domain name to this repository.
	</div>
	
	<div class="new_h2">What are the main files?</div>
	<div class="p1">
		The files used for hosting the website are:
		<ul>
			<li>A</li>
			<li>CNAME</li>
		</ul>
		We downloaded a couple files from Open Layers 3 that would allow the map to work on our website.
		These files were stored directly onto the repository so that they would not go out of date. Here are the
		links to the original files that we used from Open Layers 3:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://openlayers.org/en/v3.0.0/css/ol.css" target="_blank" style="color:white">ol.css</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://openlayers.org/en/v3.0.0/build/ol.js" target="_blank" style="color:white">ol.js</a></li>
		</ul>
		We needed to create several unique files for the user to interact with our website and also personally
		format the website code. Here is a list of the main files created for the website.
		<ul>
			<li>index.html</li>
			<li>styles.css</li>
			<li>map.js</li>
			<li>Joseph Smith Life.kml</li>
			<li>UserDocumentation.html</li>
			<li>DesignDocument.html</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="new_h2">What are the key classes and functions?</div>
	<!-- First showing the HTML coding -->
	<div class="new_h3">HTML Code</div>
	<div class="p1">
		For our HTML code, we found that most of the unique tags and formatting where to be done using div tags. We
		had several different classes that we created and accessed from the CSS code. Some examples of how we used
		the div tags are for the map, custom paragraphs, and custom headers. The following is an example of how this text
		is using a div tag.
	</div>
	<blockquote>
		<pre>
			<code>
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
	(input text here)
&lt;/div&gt;
			</code>
		</pre>
	</blockquote>

	<!-- Then showing the CSS coding -->
	<div class="new_h3">CSS Code</div>
	<div class="p1">
		In our CSS code, we needed to create and format several different new classes to accomadate the formatting
		we wanted to display on our website. This would allow us to change the formatting in one place, but have the
		style be uniform accross our website. The following is some sample code of our website of the custom headers
		we used accross the website:
	</div>
	<blockquote>
		<pre>
			<code>
/* new headers since the normal ones are being buggy */
.new_h1 {
	font-weight: normal;
	text-align: center;
	color: #ffffff;
	font-size: 34px;
	margin: 0 0 20px;
	padding: 5px 0
}
.new_h2 {
	font-weight: normal;
	text-align: center;
	color: #ffffff;
	font-size: 20px;
	margin: 0 0 15px;
	padding: 5px 0
}
.new_h3 {
	font-weight: normal;
	text-align: center;
	color: #ffffff;
	font-size: 18px;
	margin: 0 0 10px;
	padding: 5px 0
}
.new_h4 {
	font-weight: normal;
	text-align: center;
	font-size: 14px;
	margin: 0 0 5px;
	padding: 0;
	color: black;
	font-weight: bold;
}
/* end of new headers css */
			</code>
		</pre>
	</blockquote>
	
	<!-- Next showing the JavaScript coding -->
	<div class="new_h3">JavaScript Code</div>
	<div class="p1">
		
	</div>
	
	<!-- showing some sample code here -->
	<blockquote>
		<pre>
			<code>
My pre-formatted "quoted" code here. NOT FINISHED YET!!!!
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
	
&lt;/div&gt;
			</code>
		</pre>
	</blockquote>
	<div class="new_h2">Why is it designed this way?</div>
	<div class="p1">
		
	</div>

	<!-- Finally showing the KML coding -->
	<div class="new_h3">KML Code</div>
	<div class="p1">
		The unique part of our KML coding was using the description tag for each of the different placemarks inside
		our pop-ups. KML has it's own unique way of coding this, but using a "CDATA" tag inside the KML allowed us to
		us our HTML and CSS to format our text inside the pop-ups. The following is an example of how this can be done.
	</div>
	<blockquote>
		<pre>
			<code>
&lt;description&gt;
&lt;![CDATA[
	&lt;div class="new_h4"&gt;Aaronic Priesthood Restoration&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="aaronic.jpg" width="250" hight="160"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		After Joseph Smith Jr. and Oliver Cowdery were
		translating the Book of Mormon, they felt impressed
		to go pray in May of 1829 about batism and the
		remission of sins that had been mentioned in the Golden
		Plates. While praying, John the Baptist visited them as
		a resurrected being and conferred the Aaronic Priesthood,
		or preparatory priesthood, upon both of them.
	&lt;/p&gt;
