        For each of your three projects you will conduct this semester, you will be required ot submit technical and design documentation when the project is complete. The document should be 3-6 pages and is intended to communciate the following information:
        Technical Specifications
        Target audience for this information is an "IT guy" who might install and provide technical support to your users
        How was the software built?
        Who built it?
        What is it's license?
        How does it get compiled?
        How does it get installed?
        What are the hardware and software limitations/requirements?
        Where can one get it? 
        Software Design
        Target audience for this information is a follow-on programmer who will debug or add more code to your program
        What is the purpose of the software?
        What is the software structure?
        What are the main files?
        What are the key classes and functions?
        Why is it designed this way?
        What are the main user interface elements?
        What is their purpose? 
        You may structure your technical and design document however you like, as long as it has the elements described above. Feel free to use screen captures and figures where appropriate to communicate the required information. However remember that any figure you show needs to be explained in the text.
        Please include at least two design figures such as a complete geoprocessing ModelBuilder workflow, a Program Flow Chart, a UML Sequence Diagram, or UML Class Diagram. You can use PowerPoint or another tool to draw your figures. Gliffy is a web based diagram drawing tool that you might find very useful. http://www.gliffy.com/uses/uml-software
