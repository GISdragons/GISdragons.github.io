      <div class="p1">
      	This website was built using godaddy.com to find a domain name
      	and Github pages to host this website.
      </div>
      
      <div class="new_h3">Domain Name</div>
      <div class="p1">
      	Our domain name of “mormonhistorygis.com” was purchased from 
      	<a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank"
      	style="color:white">godaddy.com</a> for 1 dollar a month for 12
      	months. With this deal we also received access to their website
      	builder. Their website builder, however, it did not provided
      	access to the basic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS control that we
      	wanted to have.
      </div>
      
      <div class="new_h3">Hosting</div>
      <div class="p1">
      	We decided to use <a href="https://pages.github.com/" 
      	target="_blank" style="color:white" >Github Pages</a> to host our
      	HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other files so that we could have full
      	control over the content and display of our website. This hosting
      	is provided for free as long as the code is open source. Our
      	repository setup on Github is named <a href="https://github.com/GISdragons/GISdragons.github.io"
      	target="_blank" style="color:white" >GISdragons.githb.io</a>.
      	Our set-up for the website was done in the following way:
      </div>
      
      <div class="new_h3">Set-up</div>
      <div class="p1">
      	Using the site manager provided by godaddy.com, we went to the
      	“DNS Zone File” to change some settings to point to the Github
      	Pages server and our Github Repository. Here on this website we
      	had to change two sections. First, the “A (Host)” section needed
      	to point to the Github Pages IP address. This was done by deleting
      	the default address and adding the “@” name to “19.230.252.153”.
      	The “CName (Alias)” section was also changed. The default “www”
      	pointer was changed to point to our repository named
      	“GISdragons.github.io”.
      </div>

	<div class="p1">
		For the Github pages, since there are two main creators of the
		website, we made a Github Organization so that both could edit and
		manage the website files.

        For each of your three projects you will conduct this semester, you will be required ot submit technical and design documentation when the project is complete. The document should be 3-6 pages and is intended to communciate the following information:
        Technical Specifications
        Target audience for this information is an "IT guy" who might install and provide technical support to your users
        How was the software built?
        Who built it?
        What is it's license?
        How does it get compiled?
        How does it get installed?
        What are the hardware and software limitations/requirements?
        Where can one get it? 
        Software Design
        Target audience for this information is a follow-on programmer who will debug or add more code to your program
        What is the purpose of the software?
        What is the software structure?
        What are the main files?
        What are the key classes and functions?
        Why is it designed this way?
        What are the main user interface elements?
        What is their purpose? 
        You may structure your technical and design document however you like, as long as it has the elements described above. Feel free to use screen captures and figures where appropriate to communicate the required information. However remember that any figure you show needs to be explained in the text.
        Please include at least two design figures such as a complete geoprocessing ModelBuilder workflow, a Program Flow Chart, a UML Sequence Diagram, or UML Class Diagram. You can use PowerPoint or another tool to draw your figures. Gliffy is a web based diagram drawing tool that you might find very useful. http://www.gliffy.com/uses/uml-software
