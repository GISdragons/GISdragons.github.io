The purpose of the code was to create a website that would allow a user to choose 18 different locations via buttons and a dropdown list that represent locations where significant events in the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith occurred. This type of project can be useful for many different applications; for example, if a company wished to display office locations, areas of interest for sales, various types of record keeping and happenings at a specific location -- the options are endless.

HTML, JavaScript, CSS and OpenLayers3 were all used together in this project which presented a unique learning experience. Web Mapping is becoming very popular so using OpenLayers3, which is an open source JavaScript library to display map data on the web, is very beneficial for the students who created this project.

This website was created by Stephen Duncan and Preston Merrell.
