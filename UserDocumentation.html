      <div class="p1">
         The purpose of the code was to create a website that would allow a user to choose 
         18 different locations via buttons and a dropdown list that represent locations where 
         significant events in the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith occurred. This type of
         project can be useful for many different applications; for example, if a company wished 
         to display office locations, areas of interest for sales, various types of record keeping 
         and happenings at a specific location -- the options are endless.

       HTML, JavaScript, CSS and OpenLayers3 were all used together in this project which presented
       a unique learning experience. Web Mapping is becoming very popular so using OpenLayers3, 
       which is an open source JavaScript library to display map data on the web, is very beneficial 
       for the students who created this project.

      A web-based Git repository hosting service called GitHub was used for this project. It is a free 
      service when the code created is open source. To obtain the code the user simply has to search 
      for repository called GISdragons/GISdragons.github.io inside the github search engine. When the 
      repository appears, the code used for the project is visible and able to be accessed.

      <div class="p1">
      One of the very first steps a user must take to create a scripts that will perform the functions 
      mormonhistorygis.com demonstrates is to create a kml file which contains the data necessary for 
      the points on the map. This was done by the authors using GoogleEarth. The kml file was then modified 
      to include any additional data desired such as a description, image, zoom, etc. The authors also 
      created two icons from the Kirtland and Nauvoo temples to be displayed on the map in this same file.
      The following figures show how to create the kml file and show the file containing the points used for 
      this project used for this project.  To create a point, right click on the file, click addïƒ point. T
      he user can then add a name and description. Right click on the folder and save type as .kml.

      OpenLayers3 offers a huge variety of map content and features. Downloading OpenLayers3 from the OpenLayers
      website is the first step. The file downloaded contains hundreds of sample code files that can be used for free.
      For this project, a simple MapQuest map was used for source of the raster layer as shown in the JavaScript code:

      <img src="background.jpg" width="400" hight="250">
      <br>
      <div class="p1">
      The kml file contains all the data needed for the points and was named Joseph Smith Life.kml and defined as the 
      vector layer under the variable name JSLife:
      </div>
      <img src="JSLife.jpg" width="400" hight="250">
      <br>
      <div class="p1">
      The two files are merged together to define the parts of the new openlayers map, the default center point 
      is defined and a zoom is set. 
      </div>
      <img src="map.jpg" width="400" hight="250">

      <div class="p1">
      The variable names used have to match exactly in order for the script to work.

      The url for the website created is mormonhistorygis.com. The default page image looks like Figure 3.

      When the user clicks on a button or an option in the dropdown list, a popup is displayed, and the map is
      zoomed into the point as shown in Figure 4:
