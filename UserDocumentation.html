          Instructions for End User Documentation
          Target audience: the actual user of your program. For example, someone who has taken Engineering Applications of GIS but not necessarily this programming class...
          You are required to submit a 3 to 6 page "help file" or end user manual/documentation for each of your three projects. The help file can take the form of a word document or a PDF file. You can also try to compile a CHM file for a professional look and feel. CHM files are standard windows help files that you are used to using. Here is a free program that is supposed to help you convert a Word document into a compiled CHM help file: http://sourceforge.net/projects/chmprocessor/.
          Your end user documentation should tell the user the folling information:
          How to get and install your software.
          What is the main purpose of the software.
          Are there any restrictions on its use (either license or hardware/software).
          How to configure input data.
          How to start the software, web site, or script.
          How to run the software, use the web site, or start the script.
          How to use, interpret, or make sense of the results of the software, web site, or script.
          You may choose to simply give a list of graphical user interface elements in your program and explain each one, although it is often better to have help file information presented in a more fluid "use-case driven" approach (i.e. tell a story about how someone would fully use the software rather than just explain each button.). 
          Each member of the team should help write the help file or user documentation. Each member of the team should also submit the final version through Learning Suite.
