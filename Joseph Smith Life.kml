			<description>
				In the Spring of 1820, Joseph Smith went into
				a grove of trees to know which church was true.
				It was here that Joseph Smith had the First Vision,
				where he saw God, the Father, and His son, Jesus Christ
				He was told none of the churches were true at the
				time. He was told he would be an instrumental part of
				restoring the fulness of the gospel to the earth again.
